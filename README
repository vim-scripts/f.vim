:call F()
This function lets you see all the lines in a file
that contain a given regular-expression.

The remaining lines are folded with the manual method,
and can be opened to see some 'nearby' line.

If no regular expression is specified, the last regular expression
specified for search is utilized.

The idea comes from the mainframe ISPF editor.

After you get your folds, you can give commands affecting only the folded lines
using:

:folddoclosed

or use:

:folddoopen

to operate only on the visible lines.

zo   to open a fold a bit
zozj to open a fold a bit and leave the cursor on the fold line
zO   to open a fold completely 
zE   to open all folds

zf{motion} to close folders 'a bit more' (or to create folders)
If you have 2 adjacent folders, zf<ENTER> will 'merge' them.
In the same way a visible line can be 'added' to a nearby folder.

:call FA()
This function is similar to F() above, except instead of typing in
a regular expression, the current word the cursor is over is used as
the regular expression.

The function FA() has been prepared and added by:

Suggested mappings:
:map <F5> :call F()<CR>
:map <F6> :normal zozj<CR>

:<Up> to recall the macro after having executed it once
